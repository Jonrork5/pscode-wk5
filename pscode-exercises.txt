// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(sum=a+b) 

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(sum=c check "c" is even, Check "c" is odd)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)(print 1,2,3,4,5)
b)(add 1+2+3+4+5=15) (divide 15/5=3)
c)(find smallest value of 1,2,3,4,5=1) (find largest value of 1,2,3,4,5=5)
d)(print 3 with message "average value of numbers 1,2,3,4,5" (print 1 with message "smallest value of 1,2,3,4,5=1) (print 5 with message "largest value of 1,2,3,4,5=5)
